                Have you ever had that moment where you stare at your screen, just trying to think of a good
                headline
                for your email, website or product... but nothing really happens? Wouldn’t it be great to just skip
                that?

                This book was initially a Google Spreadsheet we (Gijs and Danny) created for our own projects. We
                were
                sick and tired of those days we kept looking at a blank screen, unable to come up with any
                headlines,
                titles or subject lines.
            </p>

            <p class="cor">
                We a/b tested the new headlines on the websites of our clients and got amazing results. Some
                headlines
                even doubled the initial conversion rates!

                Quickly, word spread around town, and a few co-workers asked us if we could share this “secret”
                collection of converting headlines with them. We did. They tested some of our headlines and saw some
                <b>very positive</b> results with these headlines as well.
                <br><br>
                They were blown away by the massive impact a headline could make. This success inspired us to share our
                collection of <b>200 headlines</b> with everyone.
